# GraphsDSA
In simple language graphs are connection between node which can be either one or many, those nodes are called neighbouring nodes.
Graph problem can be solved with the help of DFS(depth first search) and BFS(breadth first search).
In DFS we mostly use recursion.
In BFS we mostly use Queue.
Here are some basic and medium graphs problem which can be solved by two traversals told above.
